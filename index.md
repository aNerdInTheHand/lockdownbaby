# Lockdown, Baby!

Hi, I'm Nick, I'm in the UK and I have a baby.

I'm also in lockdown - again.

I also have no idea what I'm doing.

If this sounds familiar to you, feel free to read on to hear some of my coping techniques.

With that out of the way, here's a very brief version of my story and some of the things I've found have helped.

## My Heroic Tale

Our bouncing baby boy was born in the early part of 2020, when "Coronavirus" was just something that was happening somewhere else and would no doubt soon be under control. The birth was difficult and the first two weeks were hard, as we tried to negotiate the early days of being first time parents.

And then as two weeks became 15 days, the crying started. And the sleep stopped. Oh no. We had a colicky baby. The only thing that worked, for months, was cradling baby or walking him in the pram. Towards the end of Spring I was walking him around 20km a day just for a modicum of peace.

So far, so normal, at least for lots of parents. But as 15 days became three weeks, the unprecedented happened, and we were thrown into lockdown.

At this point I was so tired and stressed anyway I didn't really think much of it, other than maybe it would give me a chance to focus on getting my life sorted out. But then things didn't go back to normal. And then baby developed reflux, and the colic got worse. As he approaches 9 months of life, we've gone back into national lockdown, and yet somehow _I am still here_. Still doing it. Still surviving.

With the help of Omeprazole, we're more or less on top of his reflux. The colic has been replaced by constant low-level whining as our little genius gets bored with every activity after 37 seconds.

The sleep... well, I guess it's improved. We had six wakes before midnight last night and he was up at 04:50, after a pretty good few nights, so yeah, the sleep. Ok. But as I say, still here - still just about functioning - still just about holding down a full time job (from home, with a whingy baby).

## How I cope

If some of the following points sound contradictory, thats's because:
- I'm sleep deprived
- You're sleep deprived
- They are contradictory

This is just a random collection of things that have helped at various times, and different things helped at different times. Remember, **I am not an expert and this is based on my own experience only**.

### Whatever it takes

As parents, we instinctively try to do _whatever it takes_ to do our best for baby. But sometimes this can be counter-intuitive if we're running ourselves into the ground, and we're pissed off and knackered and getting angry with baby. And baby will pick up on that. And baby will cry. And the cycle continues. So do whatever it takes do you your best for all of you. If this means rocking the baby to sleep and holding them for a nap instead of perservering with putting them down just to get some short term relief for you (and your partner), do it\*. If it means giving in and taking the baby for a walk in the pram at 3am, do it.\* If it means switching from breast to bottle fed because your wife (or you - I'm just writing this from a dad's perspective) can no longer take feeding baby _every 45 minutes 24/7_, do it!\* Because anything that gives you a bit of a break lets you be that little bit more patient with baby.

### Walk

Get outside and just walk. Cold? Wrap up. Raining? Waterproofs on. Hot? Strip off. Just get out and walk. And while you're at it...

### Switch off

I'm lucky enough to live in a beautiful part of the world so I like to have my phone with me to take photos. But most of the time I stick it on aeroplane mode and just enjoy the fresh air and the view.

### Turn off the news

It's never good anyway, is it?

### Know the rules

I'm not advocating looking for loopholes that allow you to go for pints with your mates. We should all do our bit to contain the virus. But make sure you're up to date with your local rules, and if they allow you to meet a friend in a park or garden, do it. Especially if you know other people with kids. You might think you can't be bothered, but you'll probably feel better for it.
